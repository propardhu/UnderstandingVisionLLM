Bringing open intelligence to all, our latest models expand context length to 128K, add support across eight languages, and include Llama 3.1 405B—the first frontier-level open source AI model. Llama 3.1 405B is in a class of its own, with unmatched flexibility, control, and state-of-the-art capabilities that rival the best closed source models.

The Meta Llama 3.3 multilingual large language model (LLM) is a pretrained and instruction tuned generative model in 70B (text in/text out). The Llama 3.3 instruction tuned text only model is optimized for multilingual dialogue use cases and outperforms many of the available open source and closed chat models on common industry benchmarks. LLaMA 3.3 70B: Released by Meta, LLaMA 3.3 70B is optimized for multilingual dialogue and instruction-following tasks.
